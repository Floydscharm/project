## What problems does this project solve?

* Limited Availability of Recent Question Papers: The official MAKAUT website provides question papers only up to the year 2019, leaving students without access to more recent exam materials. This lack of up-to-date question papers hampers students' ability to become familiar with the evolving exam patterns and current question types.

* Insufficient Study Materials Provided by University: While the university occasionally offers study materials and notes, these resources are often limited in scope and may not comprehensively cover the various subjects and topics across different streams. As a result, students may struggle to find in-depth explanations and examples for a well-rounded understanding.

* Scarcity of Topic-wise Content Online: Despite the vast expanse of the internet, finding organized and topic-specific study content tailored to the MAKAUT curriculum can be a daunting task. Students seeking to delve deeper into specific subjects often encounter a scarcity of reliable resources that cater to their exact learning needs.

## Problem Solution

* Limited Availability of Recent Question Papers:
ExamArchive offers a repository of recent question papers, filling the gap left by the official MAKAUT website. We diligently collect and curate question papers from post-2019 periods, allowing students to access up-to-date exam materials. This ensures that students are well-prepared for current exam patterns and question types, leading to improved exam performance.

* Insufficient Study Materials Provided by University:
Recognizing the limitations of university-provided study materials, ExamArchive offers comprehensive study notes that cover a wide range of subjects and topics across different streams. Our team of subject experts meticulously craft these notes, providing detailed explanations and examples to facilitate a deeper understanding of key concepts. Students can rely on ExamArchive to complement their existing study resources and fill gaps in their understanding.

* Scarcity of Topic-wise Content Online:
ExamArchive addresses the scarcity of topic-wise content online by offering a diverse range of organized study materials. Our platform categorizes study resources by subjects, streams, and topics, enabling students to easily locate and access content tailored to their learning needs. This empowers students to explore specific subjects in depth and gain a more holistic grasp of their coursework.

## Challenges we ran into

* Data Collection: Curating and verifying a comprehensive collection of question papers and study notes from different streams and years.
* User Experience: Designing an intuitive user interface that simplifies browsing and downloading of resources.
* Community Engagement: Creating an interactive environment that encourages learners to actively participate and collaborate.
